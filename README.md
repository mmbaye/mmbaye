**About me**
I'm a researcher at the Senegalese Institute of Agricultural Research (ISRA), and I'm based at the Regional Center of Excellence on Dry Cereals and Associated Crops (CERAAS). My work primarily revolves around modernizing plant breeding programs in response to climate change, with a focus on optimizing water usage and implementing advanced monitoring techniques for food production in Africa. I’m using cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence-based imaging technologies, and high-throughput phenotyping. My research focuses on the integration of advanced remote sensing, machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision for agricultural applications. Here are the different topics I'm working on:

1. Utilizing digital technology to enhance agricultural productivity, efficiency, and sustainability.
2. Harmonizing essential satellite remote sensing data products for the agricultural sector.
4. Designing drone-based imaging platforms for precision agriculture and modelling.
5. Quantifying and modelling crop stress for accurate assessment.
6. Harnessing the power of multi-source remote sensing to gain comprehensive insights.
